# ParkSphere MVP Checklist

## âœ… Architecture & Scalability

### Database Design
- [x] Models support all required fields
- [x] Indexes on frequently queried columns (id, nps_code, biome)
- [x] SQLite for MVP with easy PostgreSQL migration path
- [x] JSON field for flexible gallery storage

### API Design
- [x] RESTful endpoints with clear naming
- [x] Pagination ready (limit/offset parameters)
- [x] Filtering capability (by biome)
- [x] Consistent error response format
- [x] API versioning (/api/v1)

### Configuration
- [x] Single setting to switch park limits (CURRENT_PARKS_LIMIT)
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Separate MVP and production settings
- [x] API keys properly managed in .env

### Asset Management
- [x] Scalable directory structure (/assets/{park_id}/)
- [x] Image processing settings (sizes, formats)
- [x] Manifest.json format defined

## âœ… Development Ready

### Testing
- [x] Test structure established
- [x] Fixtures for mock data
- [x] Test database configuration
- [ ] Tests to be written alongside code

### Documentation
- [x] PRD with clear vision
- [x] API design document
- [x] Development guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Progress tracking system

### Security
- [x] .gitignore for sensitive files
- [x] Environment variables for secrets
- [x] No hardcoded credentials

## ðŸ”„ Plug & Play Data Ingestion

The system is designed so that changing from 10 to 63 parks requires only:

1. Update `CURRENT_PARKS_LIMIT` in config.py
2. Add more rows to parks_mvp_seed.csv
3. Run the ingest script with new limit

No code changes needed - the same components handle both MVP and full product.

## ðŸ“‹ Ready to Build

With this foundation, the MVP can be built incrementally:
1. Each component can be tested in isolation
2. Simple changes with minimal code impact
3. Clear separation of concerns
4. Scalable from day one

The architecture ensures that what works for 10 parks will work seamlessly for 63+ parks.
