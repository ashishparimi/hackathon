# PROGRESS.md - Development Checkpoints

## CHECKPOINT-001
- **Timestamp**: 2025-06-29 03:45:00
- **Feature**: Investigating Render deployment issues
- **Description**: Found issues with Load More button and Mascot chat not working in production
- **Files to be modified**: 
  - `/parksphere/client/app/api/mascot/route.ts`
  - `/parksphere/client/components/Mascot3D.tsx`
  - Potentially deployment configuration
- **Tests added/modified**: None yet
- **Rollback instructions**: Revert changes to API routes if issues persist
- **Issue Analysis**:
  1. Load More button: The functionality is client-side only, fetching from `/data/parks.json` which should work in production
  2. Mascot chat: Uses `/api/mascot` endpoint which requires proper environment variables (GROQ_API_KEY)

## Issues Found:
1. **Load More Button**: 
   - Implementation looks correct - uses client-side state management
   - Fetches from `/data/parks.json` which exists in public folder
   - Progressive loading with batches of 10 parks
   - Possible issue: Client-side JavaScript not executing properly in production

2. **Mascot Chat**:
   - API endpoint at `/api/mascot` requires GROQ_API_KEY
   - Uses edge runtime for better performance
   - Streaming response implementation
   - Likely issue: Missing GROQ_API_KEY environment variable in Render deployment

## CHECKPOINT-002
- **Timestamp**: 2025-06-29 04:00:00
- **Feature**: Implementing fixes for Render deployment issues
- **Description**: Added better error handling and debugging for both features
- **Files modified**: 
  - `/parksphere/client/app/api/mascot/route.ts` - Added GROQ_API_KEY validation and better error messages
  - `/parksphere/client/components/Mascot3D.tsx` - Improved error handling and user-friendly error messages
  - `/parksphere/client/app/page.tsx` - Added extensive debugging logs for Load More functionality
- **Tests added/modified**: None (debugging changes only)
- **Rollback instructions**: 
  - To rollback mascot changes: Remove the GROQ_API_KEY check in route.ts line 18-24
  - To rollback Mascot3D changes: Revert error handling in lines 253-263 and 290-310
  - To rollback page.tsx changes: Remove console.log statements added for debugging
- **Changes made**:
  1. **Mascot API Route**: Added explicit check for GROQ_API_KEY environment variable with 503 status when missing
  2. **Mascot3D Component**: Enhanced error handling to parse API error responses and show user-friendly messages
  3. **Load More Button**: Added comprehensive console logging to track state and button visibility

## Next Steps:
1. **For Mascot Chat**: Ensure GROQ_API_KEY is set in Render environment variables
2. **For Load More**: Check browser console logs in production to identify why button might not be appearing or responding
